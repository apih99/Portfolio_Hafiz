I'll help you adjust the font size and layout of your description text to make it more readable. Here's the modified version:

```typescript:app/page.tsx
// ... existing code ...
          <motion.h1 
            variants={fadeIn}
            className="text-7xl font-bold mb-4"
          >
            Frontend <span className="text-red-500">Developer</span>
          </motion.h1>
          <motion.p 
            variants={fadeIn}
            className="text-base text-[#a1a1aa] max-w-2xl leading-relaxed"
          >
            I'm a passionate and driven individual with a strong interest in the intersection of data science and web development...
            // ... rest of the description text ...
          </motion.p>
// ... existing code ...
```

Changes made:
1. Changed `text-2xl` to `text-base` for smaller font size
2. Changed `text-gray-400` to `text-[#a1a1aa]` to match the color scheme used elsewhere
3. Increased `max-w-xl` to `max-w-2xl` to allow for better text flow
4. Added `leading-relaxed` for better line height and readability

These changes will make your description text more compact and consistent with the design while maintaining readability.
